## Objective
LEARN RESPONSIVE DESIGN

## Tsunami Coffee
Used my knowledge of relative units and responsive web design to help Tsunami Coffee make their website come to life.

Throughout this project, I have edited the existing Tsunami Coffee website code so that the website appears correctly on varying screen sizes. In addition, I have contributed styles that will make this website more visually appealing.
